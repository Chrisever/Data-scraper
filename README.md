# Data-scraper
Designed by Claude

I'll help you design a web scraper. There are several approaches depending on your needs, so let me create a comprehensive Python-based web scraper with multiple features.Advanced Web ScraperCodeÂ import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import pandas as pd
import time
import random
from urllib.parse import urljoin, urlparse
import json
import csv
from dataclasses import dataclass
from typing import List, Dict, Optional, Callable
import lI've created a comprehensive web scraper design with the following key features:
Core Components:

WebScraper Class - The main scraper with configurable options
ScrapedData Dataclass - Structured data storage
Multiple Extraction Methods - Both requests/BeautifulSoup and Selenium support
Built-in Politeness - Random delays, proper headers, rate limiting

Key Features:

Dual Engine Support: Choose between lightweight requests/BeautifulSoup or full browser automation with Selenium
Smart Content Extraction: Automatically extracts titles, headings, paragraphs, links, images, and meta data
Custom Selectors: Define specific CSS selectors for targeted content extraction
Multiple Export Formats: Save data as JSON or CSV
Error Handling: Robust error handling with detailed logging
Rate Limiting: Configurable delays between requests to be respectful to servers
Human-like Behavior: Realistic headers and random delays to avoid detection

Usage Examples:
The code includes specialized functions for:

News article scraping
E-commerce product data extraction
JavaScript-heavy site scraping

Setup Requirements:
bashpip install requests beautifulsoup4 pandas selenium lxml
For Selenium, you'll also need to install ChromeDriver and ensure it's in your PATH.
Ethical Considerations:

Always check robots.txt before scraping
Respect rate limits and add appropriate delays
Consider the website's terms of service
Don't overload servers with too many concurrent requests

Would you like me to modify any specific aspects of the scraper or add additional features like proxy support, database integration, or specific content extraction methods?
